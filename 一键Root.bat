rem
rem  Double-click this file. It runs auto_root.sh which:
rem    [0] shows the safety notes and asks y/n
rem    [1] checks adb and the device connection
rem    [2] prepares everything (carrier app / v7 target / guard files / magiskpolicy)
rem    [3] runs the grind in the background
rem    [4] prints live status + watch logs every 30s, and loudly reports
rem        UID0 / FLASH START / FLASH DONE
rem
rem  NOTE: this .bat is intentionally ASCII-only (cmd.exe mis-parses UTF-8
rem  batch files after "chcp"). All Chinese messages are printed by
rem  auto_root.sh instead.
rem
rem  Exit codes: 0=uid0 achieved  2=no hit this run  3=env/prep error
rem              4=device missing 5=declined at safety gate 130=Ctrl+C
